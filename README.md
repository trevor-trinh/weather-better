## Overview

**WeatherBetter** is a decentralized weather betting Dapp that revolutionizes how users engage with weather forecasts. With our platform, users can bet on the weather of a specific place and date, turning everyday weather predictions into exciting opportunities for profit or pleasant surprises.

## How it Works

Imagine you're planning a trip to Sydney in a week, and you're worried about rain ruining your adventure. With WeatherBetter, you can place a bet, like 100 USDC, on rainy weather for that day. If it doesn't rain, you lose your bet but gain a sunny day for your trip. However, if the weather doesn't cooperate, you could win some money to compensate for your ruined plans!
