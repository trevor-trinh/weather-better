# WeatherBetter üå§Ô∏èüåßÔ∏è

## Overview

**WeatherBetter** is a decentralized weather betting Dapp that revolutionizes how users engage with weather forecasts. With our platform, users can bet on the weather of a specific place and date, turning everyday weather predictions into exciting opportunities for profit or pleasant surprises.

## How it Works

Imagine you're planning a trip to Sydney in a week, and you're worried about rain ruining your adventure. With WeatherBetter, you can place a bet, like 100 USDC, on rainy weather for that day. If it doesn't rain, you lose your bet but gain a sunny day for your trip. However, if the weather doesn't cooperate, you could win some money to compensate for your ruined plans!

## Key Technologies

### 1. Chainlink's CCIP Technology and Weather Data Feeds

Chainlink's CCIP technology enables a cross-chain token bridge between the Base chain and Ethereum, enhancing the user experience. Weather data feeds ensure accurate and reliable weather information, triggering automated asset allocations among winners.

### 2. Base Sepolia and Avalanche Fuji

Base Sepolia and Avalanche Fuji provide the blockchain infrastructure to record on-chain transactions and execute smart contracts securely and efficiently, safeguarding users' funds.

### 3. Nouns Vibe and Art

Partnering with NounsDAO brings a unique brand and vibe to WeatherBetter, aligning perfectly with our fun and quirky product style, making it more appealing to users.

### 4. Worldcoin Proof-of-Humanity

Our project is committed to combating bots and sybil attacks, ensuring that our platform delivers genuine value to real users. Integration with Worldcoin's proof-of-humanity mechanism enhances security and authenticity.

### 5. Unlimit Wallet

Seamless integration with Unlimit's on/off ramps ensures accessibility for both web2 and web3 users, making WeatherBetter widely accessible and user-friendly.
